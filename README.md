# My personal web site

I worked my way through a long list of blogging platforms, until I found myself dangling from the end of it, unhappy enough to write my own.

Inspired by [Jekyll][], [Hyde][] and [MultiMarkdown-CMS][mmd], the main goals were

- simple, static
- quick build times
- a staging area for messing around

[Jekyll]: https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/
[Hyde]: https://github.com/hyde/hyde
[mmd]: https://github.com/fletcher/MultiMarkdown-CMS

Dependencies:

- Markdown
- Python (Jinja2)
- SASS
